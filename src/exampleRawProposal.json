The first transaction creates the action on the DAO and we have to wait 24 hours before we can send a second transaction to execute it. This delay period was included for security, during that time the action can be paused by any DAO committee or SAB member.\n\nThese two transactions have significant gas costs measured in ETH. The fee is extracted from the wallet sending the transaction, the DAO Committee Member’s wallet.\n\nThere are other cases in which the members of the DAO Committee also spend gas, for example deploying vesting contracts and transferring the ownership of them to the DAO. Some polls may also require the Committee to take on-chain action which incurs in gas fees.\n\nThe addresses of the DAO Committee are:\n\n*   0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc (Yemel)\n*   0xBef99f5f55CF7cDb3a70998C57061B7e1386a9b0 (HPrivakos)\n*   0x3323B7264F7D5e8f98e6aFCcec73b6bA1116AE19 (Eric)\n\n### Motivation\n\nI’m the one who has sent more transactions in the group.
